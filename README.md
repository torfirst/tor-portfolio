# tor-portfolio

## Description

This project served two purposes: an exercise as I practice my HTML/CSS skills, and a portfolio website that I can use to display my future projects.

Since I had the freedom to create a website tailored to me, I had to learn a lot to execute the design choices I made. I had to solve an issue where my website was overflowing off the screen to the right, and figure out how to create a collapsible section for my "About Me." I also had to learn how to make the collapsible section open or closed by default because I wasn't sure what I liked visually.
